               Since 1961 the Madagascan national airline Air Madagascar has been connecting the "Grande Ile" to the world while its many domestic destinations contribute to the opening and development of its different regions.
               <br><br>
               Its vision: to be the preferred African airline.
               <br>
               Its mission: to be a lever to Madagascar's economic growth.
               <br>
               Its values: Honesty, Integrity, Respect, Excellence.
               <br><br>
               The airline was formed in 1947 to feed into flights by Transports AÃ©riens Intercontinentaux and Air France, and upon the independence of Madagascar, it became the national airline.
